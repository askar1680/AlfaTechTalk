// Welcome, Build Wrangler!
//
// A failure in this test indicates that there is a potential ABI breaking
// change in the Standard Library. If you observe a failure, please reach out to
// the Standard Library team directly to make sure we resolve this quickly!
//
// Please DO NOT XFAIL THIS TEST. (In addition to ignoring the current set of
// ABI breaks, XFAILing this test also silences any future ABI breaks that may
// land on this branch, which isn't ideal.)
//
// Instead, consider extending the list of expected changes at the bottom. You
// can find a diff of what needs to be added in the output of the failed test
// run. The order of lines doesn't matter, and you can also include comments to
// refer to any bugs you filed.

// Thanks! -- Your friendly stdlib engineers
